# Weather Reporting System

This is a .NET-based console application designed to fetch and display weather reports, including temperature, humidity, and weather forecasts. The system leverages generic APIs for weather data and utilizes Redis caching to optimize performance. SQLite is used as the relational database for storing necessary data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Fetch real-time weather reports such as temperature, humidity, and forecasts.
- Redis caching for low-latency and efficient data retrieval.
- Automatic cache updates every 1-2 hours to reflect the latest weather predictions.
- SQLite database for lightweight and efficient relational data storage.
- Console-based interface for straightforward output.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)  
2. Install [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/)  
3. Ensure SQLite is available on your system  

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/WeatherReportingSystem.git](https://github.com/vedant979/weather-forecast-system)
   cd weather-forecast-system
   ```

2. Configure the application:  
   Update `appsettings.json` with your API keys, Redis, and SQLite connection details.

3. Restore dependencies:  
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:  
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

5. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## 🌐 API Integration

This project uses generic weather APIs. Replace `<Your-API-Key>` in `appsettings.json` with your actual API key. Ensure the API endpoints are correctly configured in the `ApiClient.cs` file.

---

## 🗄️ Caching with Redis

- Redis is used for caching weather data to reduce API calls and improve response times.  
- Cache updates occur automatically every 1-2 hours to ensure data freshness.

---

## 🗃️ Database Schema

- **Table**: WeatherData  
  - `Id` (int, Primary Key)  
  - `Temperature` (float)  
  - `Humidity` (float)  
  - `Forecast` (string)  
  - `Timestamp` (datetime)
